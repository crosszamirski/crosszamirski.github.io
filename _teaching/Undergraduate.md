I supervised students taking the [Mathematical Biology](https://www.natsci.tripos.cam.ac.uk/subject-information/part1a/qbiol) course as part of the Natural Sciences Tripos for the academic year 2019-2020. I had groups of students at [Jesus College](https://www.jesus.cam.ac.uk/) and [St. Catharine's College](https://www.caths.cam.ac.uk/).
