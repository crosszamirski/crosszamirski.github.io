Welcome to my page! 

I am PhD student under the supervision of [Professor Carola-Bibiane Sch√∂nlieb](https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/cbs31/Home.html) in the [Cambridge Image Analysis](http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/research/cia/) group at [DAMTP](https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/), University of Cambridge. We collaborate with [Dr Yinhai Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WNY0TscAAAAJ&hl=en) and the Quantitative Biology group at [AstraZeneca](https://www.astrazeneca.co.uk/). 

My research interests include:
  - Using multi-modal data and image metadata to adapt and enhance models in applied computer vision tasks
  - Self-supervised learning, representation learning, image-to-image tasks
  - Image-level models applied to cell microscopy data for drug discovery
