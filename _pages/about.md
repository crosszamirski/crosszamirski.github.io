Welcome to my page! 

I am PhD student under the supervision of [Professor Carola-Bibiane Sch√∂nlieb](https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/cbs31/Home.html) in the [Cambridge Image Analysis](http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/research/cia/) group at [DAMTP](https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/), University of Cambridge. We collaborate with [Dr Yinhai Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WNY0TscAAAAJ&hl=en) and the quantitive biology group at [AstraZeneca](https://www.astrazeneca.co.uk/).
